## An Overload of Website Tools
A pair of scissors, a straight razor, a machete, a lawn mower, and a sword lay in out in the open. If someone were to ask to cut the grass outside by any means, then it seems obvious that the lawn mower would be the appropriate option. However, in the broadest sense of knowledge, technically each tool could get the job done, but the lawn mower is designed specifically to cut grass. This situation can relate to web design and the use of UI frameworks compared to raw HTML and CSS. 

When it comes to creating a website, raw HTML and CSS should be the move right? It was the very first iterations when creating a website and if it ain't broke don't fix it right? What do you mean you don't want to cut the grass with a pair of scissors? If it ain't broke don't fix it right? Well you get the point.

The difference in terms of website building is that learning UI frameworks feels like its own time consuming process of understanding a different point of view of web design that it might not feel fulfilling to even learn. However, even when cutting grass, there are times when the tall grass can be too tall for the lawn mover to cut. There, a machete can cut through the thickets easily and give an easier time for the lawn mower. In this case with UI frameworks, it can offer other solutions to problems that can occur when using raw HTML.


## The Semantics of Web Design
When it came to creating a website using raw HTMl and CSS, since this was my first time working with HTML, many of these things were new to me, and so when it came to understanding HTML, it felt like learning a new language all over again. So, when it came to semantic ui as the first of many UI frameworks, it felt like even more of a tall task to remember. However, once I started to view the limits of raw HTML, there was many roundabout ways to be able to make the website look a certain way.

Working more and more with semantic ui, it was very confusing at first due to the ui terms that were used, but as I slowly understood the classes and the specialized class and div styling, many aspects of regular websites began to show. It surprised me to see that while using semantic ui, the icons, menu styles, and other containers are very similar to many websites.
