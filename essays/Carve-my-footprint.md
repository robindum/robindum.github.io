## The Journey Ahead
Software engineering is one of the several tool kits that I want to become proficient in when it comes to my path of being a Computer Science major. Many of the courses that I have taken already have been the learning blocks to be able to code in several different languages such as Java, C, and C++. However, even though my toolbelt is full of tools on how to write code for each language, my experience with applying these tools to create projects is somewhat little, for now.

When it comes to the general application of these skills, my only experience currently is the very few creative coding projects to create a simple game, implementing functions for situational problems, and small personal projects. That being said, my goal for ICS 314 and for future projects is to be able to know how to translate my knowledge and my coding toolbelt into coding projects that can show off what I can do as a programmer or software engineer. 

## Footprints in the Sand
So far, it only feels that the projects that I have been able to do were similar to leaving my footprints in the sand along the beach side. To me, they were memorable but at this point, only I am the one who will remember my footprints in the sand. Through my classes, I want to be able to develop longer lasting projects especially in web development to leave longer lasting footprints for people to see.

Currently I am excited to see how to develop faster ways to code and build softwares. My desire is to create bigger projects such as website building and maybe even be able to translate my old projects that proved to be too ambitious for me at the time into something of fruition that I am proud to show as something that I created.
