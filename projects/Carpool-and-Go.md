## UH Carpool and Go!

### The Goal
For our software engineering and website development class, our final project was to coordinate with a group in order to create a proposed mockup of a website service that shall help aid the university in some type of way. Our group's task was to create a website dedicated to being a central hub of carpooling access that users can easily log into in order to either offer rides to the UH Manoa campus or look for possible drivers. Our goal was to be the connector for UH staff and students to be able to get to campus with less cars on the road, saving gas and helping reduce car pollution in the process.

### The Team


We decided to take my idea on a smaller scale, with one game but with selectable characters that the player can choose. This way, it still implemented my ambitions on a reasonable scale to allow us to be able to properly work together to code the game and have it ready by the deadline at the end of the month. We decided to base our project off of a turtle swimming through the ocean, and it must collect jellyfish while dodging the trash. The use of arrays, random number generators, and inheritance classes as well as other Java code to make it happen. Now with a reachable goal in mind, we were able to start climbing to reach the deadline on time.

It is also around the same time that I realized that conflicting time schedules is a major problem in a group collaboration, second to communication. As the other two began to be more occupied with either their job or other classes, it was left to me to pick up the slack and double my workload to finish the project on time. My biggest takeaway from my first ever collaboration project was that communication was everything, from how big the scale of the project should be, to knowing everyoneâ€™s availability to be able to work on the project, and just understanding how much each person can offer.

Our project was turned in on time and you can view it [here](https://youtu.be/2fO6JHkCsOw).
